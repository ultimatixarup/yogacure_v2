You should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal data to us via the Internet. You are solely responsible for the protection of your Device, including any use of Dr. Yogi or any storage of Personal Information or Practice Data incident to the use of Dr. Yogi on your Device.

You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Device password. Personal Information or Practice Data that is stored on your Device is your responsibility. In the event that your Device becomes lost or inoperable, your Practice Data may not be recoverable (see relevant sections above).
